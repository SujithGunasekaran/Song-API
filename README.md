# Song-API
  
  -> Sample Project To Build Own API
  
# About This Project ðŸ“‹

  * This API is Completely build on Express.js, `node.js` Web Framework
  
  * I have implemented `GET` and `POST` Method in this API.
  
  * If we like to add songs data, With the help of `post` method we can send.
  
  * I have used mongodb to store the data.
  
  * In `GET` Request. I have added two query param
  
      -> maxResult
      
      -> filmName
     
    maxResult is used to get minimum no.of data we want, and If we want only film songs we can send film name in filName Param. 
     
  * Run `npm run dev` and in localhost:5000 we can able to see page. There we can Test api for both get and post method. Pages rendered on server side.
